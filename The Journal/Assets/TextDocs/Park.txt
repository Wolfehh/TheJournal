It seems another has come to the same conclusion as me. They’re fed up with the doctor’s fight club.
I had thought many times about what would happen if I were to fight the doctor. I am fortunate to see what would happen to me if I were to follow that path.
It doesn't end well. They were brutally murdered in the streets by other doped up townsfolk. He didn't force me to help. He knows. He wants me to know.
The creature speaks to me. We're afraid.
