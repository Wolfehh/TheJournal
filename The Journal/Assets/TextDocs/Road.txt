Friday - Road to Town
I brought her to the kids. She woke up while I was transferring her. She was mad. I told her I would handle it.
She fought back, yelling at me, begging me to hear her out. I knocked her out, I'm sorry for the bruise, I hope you forgive me.
I told the kids to make sure she didn't return and left her a note. She will find my brother. I buried the trail.
I made a deal, the creature can have some time to mess around in the woods if they help me knock the trees down.
I don't know why the creature agreed, they didn't get to kill anyone. I'm going to confront the doctor.
