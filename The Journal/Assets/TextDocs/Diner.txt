Saturday - Diner
I accepted his deal. I am to be his test subject. If I am to find out anything I must stay in town.
With his daughter missing, I cannot safely stay here without accepting the deal. He asked me what I know.
I lied through my teeth. "It just makes me a little angrier."
Though he was willing to basically kill his own daughter, he may not take kindly to knowing that I was mere seconds from doing so myself because of his “wonder” pills.
