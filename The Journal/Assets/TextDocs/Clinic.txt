Saturday - Outside Clinic
I am writing this from a mind not my own. I am unsure if I will survive this. The creature had an idea, a crazy horrible idea.
"Take a dozen pills. Then I will overpower the concoction and our dream will be fulfilled." I am in a battle to exist within my own mind.
The creature did not say if I will return, we will just have to find out. Here's hoping.
