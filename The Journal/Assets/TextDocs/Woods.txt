Sunday - Woods
I've received more pills. Townsfolk are picking fights amongst one another and the doctorâ€™s running fight clubs.
He wants to make me his prized fighter. I have no choice but to harm. This gives me an advantage.
I get to show the creature I agreed to the terms without choosing to throw away my humanity. The creature enjoys the fights, we are bonding.
I remind them that we need to act out for the doctor, we need to fake the results he wants. I think he's working on a new concoction, the creature fears this concoction.
We both want him to think what he has now is good, but I think he suspects that it may be an act. This isn't good. I need to kill him.
