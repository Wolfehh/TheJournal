Wednesday - Writers House
He's injected me secretly with small doses of the concoction. The work me and the creature have done is for nothing. We aren't allowed to control it.
All day yesterday, we were made to do as he instructed. I fear I underestimated my enemy. He's been fine tuning with the people he has left, I am his strongest asset.
By teaming up with the creature, we became more powerful. More useful. If you are reading this, run. Do not remain in this town. Find a way out.
Thursday - Writers Room
I have killed 5 people. I once knew them all. It is my last chance to fight the doctor before he controls me completely. I may as well go out trying.
I'm sorry for the ones I've harmed, killed. Please let my family know I love them and I hope they all live on.
Brother, I hope you make it far, you've worked harder than anyone and those who refused to see it be damned. To her, I'm sorry.
It appears you were right, as you were many times, I should have heard you out. I promise I'll make things right.
