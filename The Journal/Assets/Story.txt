Hello, I'm not sure who's going to be reading this. I'm writing this in what very well might be my last moments.
I might as well start from the beginning.
Some man came into town about a few weeks ago, we didn't think much of it and have always been somewhat of an open town.
Kids playing in the park and all that happy shit.
He started befriending the town council, which wasn’t particularly abnormal, we’re all friends with them.
